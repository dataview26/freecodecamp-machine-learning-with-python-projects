🪨✂️📄 Rock Paper Scissors (FreeCodeCamp ML Project)

This project was built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python Certification.
It uses a Python-based algorithm to learn and predict moves in the classic Rock–Paper–Scissors game by recognizing patterns in the opponent’s play history.

The program automatically plays against multiple built-in opponents and improves its performance by adapting to their strategies.

🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to create an intelligent agent that can:

Play Rock–Paper–Scissors automatically.

Analyze the opponent’s previous moves.

Predict the opponent’s next move and choose the best counter.

Improve accuracy through repeated simulations.

---

🧠 How It Works

The program keeps track of each opponent’s move history.

It detects recurring patterns and predicts what the opponent will likely play next.

A simple rule-based logic determines which move beats the predicted one.

The model updates its predictions after each round to improve over time.

Its performance is evaluated by the overall win percentage after many simulated games.

📊 Results

The algorithm was tested against several built-in opponents provided by FreeCodeCamp.
Approximate performance results were:

Quincy: around 99.9% win rate

Abbey: around 64.8% win rate

Kris: around 65.6% win rate

Mrugesh: around 97.0% win rate
